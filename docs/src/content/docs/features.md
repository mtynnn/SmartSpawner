### Advanced Stacking System
Reduce server lag with **seamless stacking mechanics**. Players can stack spawners **directly by right-clicking** or using a dedicated GUI.

#### Stacking Methods
Players can stack spawners using various methods:

| Method | Description | Usage |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Right-click** | Add one spawner to stack | Right-click with spawner in hand |
| **Bulk Stacking** | Stack all spawners | Shift + Right-click |
| **GUI Control** | Precise stack management | Use Stacker GUI |

#### Stacking By Hand
Players can stack spawners manually by placing them in the desired configuration.

**Benefits:**

- Easy visual management
- Ensures drop rates scale proportionally with stack size

### Mineable Spawners  
Players can **break and collect spawners** using **specific tools** (e.g., Silk Touch), fully customizable via configuration.
```yml
spawner_break:
  # Master switch for spawner breaking feature
  enabled: true

  # Whether to directly add spawner items to player inventory
  direct_to_inventory: false

  # Tool Requirements - Which tools can break spawners
  required_tools:
    - IRON_PICKAXE
    - GOLDEN_PICKAXE
    - DIAMOND_PICKAXE
    - NETHERITE_PICKAXE

  # Durability impact on tools when breaking a spawner
  durability_loss: 1    # Number of durability points deducted

  # Enchantment Requirements for successful spawner collection
  silk_touch:
    required: true      # Whether Silk Touch is needed to obtain spawners
    level: 1            # Minimum level of Silk Touch required
```
